     SHAWNDELL BOYD:
        I attended Central State University in Wilberforce, OH and graduated in 2006 with a Bachelor’s in Psychology.
        I got a job right out of college and didn’t enjoy it and I set myself on a different career path.
        I decide to become a personal trainer and I’ve loved it ever since. I’m nationally certified personal trainer by American Aerobic Association International (AAAI) & International Sports Medicine Association (ISMA).
        In my 8 years I have trained all different type of clients from clients rehabbing from injuries, basketball players, professional MMA fighters, the working class, and power-lifters.
        I got into training because I love seeing clients become happy with their own image and I love to see people push themselves when they think they can’t push anymore.
